#	This RPS outcome description file describes contest results for
#	various multi-level RPS (Rock/Paper/Scissors) games.  It is intended
#	for use with the rps_gen script, which is designed to let a user
#	play RPS against an opponent using any odd-numbered play list between
#	3 plays and 25 plays.
#
#	It's important to note that rps_gen's game logic is completely
#	separate from the contents of this file, so aside from the PLAYx:
#	lines listed above, the order or even content of the lines herein has
#	no impact on the actual game play.  rps_gen will identify its WINNER
#	and LOSER based on applying its contest logic to the play list
#	provided on invocation and the selections of the players (e.g., human
#	and computer).  If an outcomes file like this one is specified,
#	rps_gen will then search that file for a line beginning with WINNER, a
#	space, any number of other characters, at least one more space, and
#	finally ending with LOSER.  The only purpose of the outcomes file is
#	to provide descriptions or "rules" spelling out WHY the WINNER
#	defeated the LOSER, e.g., "PAPER covers ROCK".  If no outcomes file is
#	specified or if rps_gen cannot find the generated contest result
#	listed in the designated outcomes file, it will generically report
#	"<WINNNER> defeats <LOSER>", where <WINNER> and <LOSER> are replaced
#	by the selected plays.
#
#	This design provides a great deal of flexibility when it comes to
#	outcomes file contents.  Outcome action descriptions, while usually
#	single words (e.g., PAPER covers ROCK) can also be somewhat more
#	complicated (e.g, TREE ensnares ship of ALIEN).  Further, a single
#	outcomes file can contain contest descriptions for many different
#	playlists; for example, this particular file lists contest results
#	for the RPS-25 playlist proposed by David Lovelace (umop.com), but it
#	also includes contest results for the common SPOCK/LIZARD RPS-5
#	variant (Lovelace uses a completely different set of playlist
#	additions, so SPOCK and LIZARD do not appear in his RPS-7, and he
#	does not describe any RPS-5).
#
#	A single outcomes file can even support different playlists with
#	contradictory contest results.  For example, Lovelace was not
#	rigorous in maintaining consistent contest results across his RPS-15
#	and RPS-25 variants.  Consequently, we see that in Lovelace's RPS-15:
#
#		LIGHTNING splits TREE
#
#	. . . but in his RPS-25 . . .
#
#		TREE diverts LIGHTNING
#
#	While these outcomes contradict each other, both are listed in this
#	outcomes file without causing a problem.  The appropriate outcome will
#	be reported by rps_gen based on the WINNER and LOSER as determined
#	by their order in the playlist of the variant being played, not their
#	appearance in this outcomes file.

#	Lovelace RPS-15 uses HUMAN in place of RPS-25's WOMAN and MAN, so we
