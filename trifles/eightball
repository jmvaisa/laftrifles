#	The default behavior is to populate the PREDICT list with the standard
#	20 answers from the Magic Eight Ball toy (per Wikipedia).  While this
#	more accurately emulates the MEB's behavior, the MEB has a strong
#	positive bias, with 10 affirmative answers, 5 negative, and 5
#	non-committal.  If any command line argument is provided (in future
#	this might be limited to a specific flag), the script will add 5
#	negative and 5 non-committal responses to the "classic" answer set in
#	order to balance the answer pool.
